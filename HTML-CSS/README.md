## **What Is HTML?**
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.

HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
- **Web development.** Developers use `HTML` code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.
- **Internet navigation.** Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as `HTML` is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.
- **Web documentation.** `HTML` makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

Here's how to write a simple "Hello, World" program in HTML.
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- head definitions go here -->
        <title> This is a program to print "Hello, World" </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- the content goes here -->
        <p>"Hello, World"</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
