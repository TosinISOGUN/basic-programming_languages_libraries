## **What Is HTML?**
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.

HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
- **Web development:** Developers use `HTML` code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.
- **Internet navigation:** Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as `HTML` is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.
- **Web documentation:** `HTML` makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

## Your first HTML Page
Let's start by creating a simple page that contains the phrase "Hello, World!" in the body. The page will also have a title - that thing that shows up in the title of the tab in your browser. The `<title>` element defines the title of the HTML page.

Here's how to write a simple "Hello, World" program in HTML.
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- head definitions go here -->
        <title> This is a program to print "Hello, World" </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- the content goes here -->
        <p>"Hello, World"</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag defines the document type that the browser is going to render. This is used for legacy reasons. If you want to get to the latest version of HTML (HTML5) then it's recommended to use this tag.

The `<p>` element defines a "paragraph", a block of text that has a small amount of spacing in between its top and bottom.

Notice how the tags have a start tag and an end tag denoted with a slash `(</p>)`. Everything in between is the content of the tag. The content of a tag can usually have additional HTML tags within them.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is an example of a simple HTML page with one paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
You may also copy and paste this code into a new file in your text editor or IDE, and save the file as `"index.html"`. The `"index.html"` file is the default file that a web server will look for when accessing a website. After saving the file, you can double click it to open it with your browser.
