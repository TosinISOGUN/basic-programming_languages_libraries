<img src="https://coincentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Coincentral-Asset-768x384.png" />

## Synopsis
The goal of this repository is to make it an interactive, user-friendly and open-source library/documentation for people who are new to programming and maybe even for those who has been long-timers. :)

For starters, the first basic syntax to be documented in these programming languages will be how to write a `"Hello, World"` program which is the typical way of introducing any programming language to beginners.

## Description
This repository contains `basic syntax` that cuts across various programming languages ranging from `HTML & CSS`, `C++`, `C`, `PHP`, `JAVA` and so on. On the long run, this repository will surely become an **open source library/documentation** where I and fellow programmers can make *references* to.
